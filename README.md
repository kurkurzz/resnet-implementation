## Small Implementation of ResNet-34

Implemented from scratch ReSNET-34 model based on paper **[Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf)** (He et al., 2005)

Guided by official code from pytorch vision: https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/torchvision/models/resnet.py

also thanks to https://madebyollin.github.io/convnet-calculator/ for calculator to calculate the convulational layers parameters.
